# MilleniumGoals

This is code used for my entries in the United Nations Millenium Development Goals competition
(https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/1/).  I'm currently sitting at 9th/890 competitors
using linear regression, a custom g-h Tracker that I wrote, and spotting some issues with the
data.  Many more ideas to try!
